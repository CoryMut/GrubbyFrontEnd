This is the repository for the front-end of the Grubby the Grape website, currently hosted at https://grubbythegrape.com/

The purpose of the website was to create a place for the comics to be stored and shared! It is constantly being worked on, but it currently features an area to view the latest comic, react to the comics using supported emoji, a place to view and search for all the comics in the series, and the ability to save your favorites. Last but not least, you can make Grubby tell you an infinite number of dad jokes!

It was made using React and the major components have basic tests (more on this to come) using jest.

The comics can be viewed without an account. Basic users can make an account in order to react to the comic with an emoji and to save their favorites. Some routes are protected and require admin access. Admins can uploaded and edit comics.
