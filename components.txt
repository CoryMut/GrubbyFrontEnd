The purpose of this site was to create a place to display my clients comics featuring a character named Grubby the Grape.

The site is currently deployed at beta.grubbythegrape.com

The site supports displaying the latest comic on the homepage, but also allows access to all 181 comics via the All Comics menu option.

All the comics are searchable and uses pagination.

Making an account is optionable, but it allows users to favorite (coming soon!) and to 'react' to the comic using a supported emoji!

Three routes are protected (two require admin and one requires auth).

UploadForm and the AdminPortal are admin protected and this is where the client can go to edit properties of the comics (such as description).
The UploadForm allows the user to upload the comic and set certain properties of the comic (like the characters involved).

Uploading involves receiving the file form the client but also resizes that image for use with srcSet as well as uploading it to a CDN
for storage. The client is shown a progress bar for all three tasks, not just the initial upload of the file. This is done on the backend
using a secured websocket.

App is styled using material-ui.
Styles are largely kept in the component, rare exceptions include components reused from previous projects that did not use material-ui.
